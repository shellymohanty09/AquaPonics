# AquaPonics

Aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture, which is growing fish and other aquatic animals, and hydroponics which is growing plants without soil. 
With this system, aquaponic farmers can grow plants anytime and anywhere. It works by recycling the water in the system. Fishes in the tank, help fertilize the soil in the overhead plant bed. Because aquaponics recycles the water in the system, we can grow in droughts and areas with little water. Additionally, farmers can remotely control the whole system using a web app.


### Unique Selling Points

* Uses 90 % less water than conventional farming methods.
* Separate fertilizers don't have to be used, completely organic by itself.
* Cheap and feasible maintenance and requires less space (even indoor with grow lights)
* Unique website to display information in graphical manner and remotely control the system  

## Implementation: 

Hardware implementation

Data transfer to firebase and then to web app


## Technology Stack  

NodeMCU, firebase, html, css, javascript, blender

### NodeMCU

Connected DHT and Ultrasonic sensor connected to NodeMCU and data sent to firebase.

### Firebase

Displaying data received on the web app.

## Prerequisites

```
None
```

## Challenges

* Controlling from webpage
* Sending data to firebase
* Hardware implementation due to lack of resources

## Getting Started

How to run the project-

1) Connect the required sensors to node mcu
2) Run the arduino code for connecting node mcu to firebase
3) Download the updated website and open index.html page in the browser

## Future Aspects

Aquaponics has high market feasiblity as it is cheap and realiable. There is a possibility that aquapoics will replace crop production in the future has it has high food production rate, low energy consumption,  more resilience to flood and drought and less water requirement than traditional methods.
